<strong>This project was carried out during a course on the Alura platform</strong>

React with TypeScript  (available in: https://react-with-type-script.vercel.app/)

In this project we use TypeScript to create a simple task organization system.

When activating the stopwatch, the time will be decremented. When finished, the task box will change to green and a completed image will appear.
